Ajax Add to Cart for extension  Magento 2 offers the main function of adding products to the cart via an AJAX pop-up. It significantly improves the user experience by allowing customers to add any product type to the cart right from the product list page. They no longer have to visit each product page, especially for products with many options such as configurable products, grouped products, and bundle products.

This extension is necessary for any ecommerce site to boost shopping experience. After tapping “Add to Cart” button, customers can select product options and add that product to cart in the Ajax pop-up. Then, another pop-up is displayed to notify the product added to cart successfully, cart subtotal and related product block which smartly promotes other products.
